Security playbooks typically include a series of steps or procedures that outline how to identify, contain, and remediate security incidents. They may also include guidelines for communicating with stakeholders, such as employees, customers, or regulatory bodies, and for reporting incidents to the appropriate authorities.

Examples of security playbooks include incident response playbooks, which provide step-by-step instructions for responding to security incidents, and disaster recovery playbooks, which outline procedures for recovering from catastrophic events such as natural disasters or cyber attacks.",03/30/2023 11:40:03,03/30/2023 11:43:04,David Robichaud,david.robichaud@skillsoft.com
